# LogicCraft

LogicCraft is a Fitch-like logical proof checker, written in
Minecraft commands using the Trident command preprocessor.

## Setup

The source files can be compiled with Trident, which will produce
a data pack and a resource pack. These may be placed in a save
file. LogicCraft should work in most worlds, but works best in
superflat worlds that do not extend above Y=5.

Once you have added the datapack and resource pack to the world,
run `/function logiccraft:clear_screen` to setup the screen and
`/function logiccraft:give_me_symbols` to get all the symbols you
need.
